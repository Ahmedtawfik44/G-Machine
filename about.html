            <h2>Meet Gamma</h2>
            <p>The idea for Cedar came to our co-founder after a nightmarish personal journey through the healthcare
                system led to confusion, frustration and disappointment. One thing was clear: The system needed to
                change. Because when the patient experience is convenient and clear, it leads to significantly better
                outcomes for providers, payers and the people they serve. Cedar’s mission is to make healthcare more
                affordable and accessible through our consumer-friendly platform that’s powered by data science, smart
                product design and personalization.</p>
